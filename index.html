            <p> The world's entire scientific ... heritage ... is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations....</p>
            <p> The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Markdown: Major contributor to John Gruber's Markdown,a lightweight markup language for generating HTML, and author of its html2text translator. The syntax for Markdown was influenced by Swartz's earlier atx language (2002),which today is primarily remembered for its syntax for specifying headers, known as atx-style headers:[252] Markdown itself remains in widespread use, with websites such as Reddit and GitHub using it.</li> 
                <li>RDF/XML at W3C: In 2001, Swartz joined the RDFCore working group at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), where he authored RFC 3870, Application/RDF+XML Media Type Registration. The document described a new media type, "RDF/XML", designed to support the Semantic Web.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h3>Software</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>DeadDrop: In 2011â€“2012, Swartz, Kevin Poulsen, and James Dolan designed and implemented DeadDrop, a system that allows anonymous informants to send electronic documents without fear of disclosure. In May 2013, the first instance of the software was launched by The New Yorker under the name Strongbox.The Freedom of the Press Foundation has since taken over development of the software, which has been renamed SecureDrop.</li>
                <li>Tor2web: In 2008, Swartz worked with Virgil Griffith to design and implement Tor2web, an HTTP proxy for Tor-hidden services. The proxy was designed to provide easy access to Tor from a basic web browser. The software is now maintained by Giovanni Pellerano within the GlobaLeaks project.</li>
